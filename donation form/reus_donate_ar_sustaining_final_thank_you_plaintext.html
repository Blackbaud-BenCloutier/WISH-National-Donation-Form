Dear [[S120:dc:donorTitle]] [[S120:dc:donorFirstName]] [[S120:dc:donorLastName]],

Thank you very much for your final sustainer donation. This is your
final donation to complete your recurring pledge of
[[S120:dc:recurringTotalPaymentAmount]]. Your support has a profound
impact on the lives of children like Adrian, who wished to inspire
other children with cancer by publishing a book about his own
experience. Because of your generosity, kids like Adrian are helping
other children become more hopeful about their futures. Thank you for
all you do to bring more hope, strength and joy to the lives of these
children.

Sincerely,

David Williams
President & Chief Executive Officer
Make-A-WishÂ® America
