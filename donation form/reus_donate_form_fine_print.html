        By making a gift to support our work, you'll join the Make-A-Wish online community.  A gift made to a Make-A-Wish chapter will sign you up to receive emails featuring wish stories from their community and ways to help, as well as emails from your local chapter, if they are different.  You may manage your email preferences and unsubscribe at any time through the ‘email preferences’ link at the bottom of our communication emails.
