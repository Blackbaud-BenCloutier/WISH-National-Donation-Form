Welcome to the Wishmaker Club!

[[S120:dc:transactionDate]]

Dear [[S120:dc:donorTitle]] [[S120:dc:donorFirstName]] [[S120:dc:donorLastName]],

Thank you for joining the Wishmaker Club! Your monthly support has a profound impact on the lives of children like Adrian, who wished to inspire other children with cancer by publishing a book about his own experience. Because of your generosity, kids like Adrian are helping other children become more hopeful about their futures. 

Thank you for all you do to bring more hope, strength and joy to the lives of these children. 

Sincerely,

David Williams
President & Chief Executive Officer
Make-A-WishÂ® America
