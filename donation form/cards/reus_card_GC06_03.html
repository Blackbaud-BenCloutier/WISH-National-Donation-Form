<h4>Story on the back</h4>
<p>Stephanie felt she had everything she needed: a great
family, close friends and improving health while being
treated for leukemia. When she decided on her heartfelt
wish, Stephanie thought of someone else she loves  kids. So
the 17-year-old and her volunteer wish granters organized a
carnival at an elementary school for homeless children.
More than 100 students enjoyed a cheerful day filled with
games, prizes, balloon art, face painting, dancing and all the
ice cream and popcorn they could eat. When it was over, one
young student was asked what his own wish would be. "I
would throw a party just like she did," he replied, a sign that
Stephanie's wish was planting her seeds of generosity.</p>
