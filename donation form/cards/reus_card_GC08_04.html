<h4>Story on the back</h4>

<p><strong>I wish to go to the Walt Disney World&reg; Resort
Lisamarie, age 12</strong></p>

<p>Lisamarie's wish came true when she visited the Walt Disney World® Resort. Lisamarie, who was diagnosed with Angelman syndrome and seizure disorder, loved whirling and twirling in the teacups on the Mad Tea Party ride, and her photo album is now filled with pictures of her posing with all of her Disney character friends.</p>
