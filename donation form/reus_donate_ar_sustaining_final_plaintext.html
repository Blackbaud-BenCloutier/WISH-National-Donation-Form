  Dear [[S120:dc:donorFirstName]] [[S120:dc:donorLastName]],

  Thank you very much for your final sustainer donation. This is your
  final donation to complete your recurring pledge of
  [[S120:dc:recurringTotalPaymentAmount]]. Your support has a profound
  impact on the lives of children like Adrian, who wished to inspire
  other children with cancer by publishing a book about his own
  experience. Because of your generosity, kids like Adrian are helping
  other children become more hopeful about their futures. Thank you for
  all you do to bring more hope, strength and joy to the lives of these
  children.

  Sincerely,

  David Williams
  President & Chief Executive Officer
  Make-A-WishÂ® America
