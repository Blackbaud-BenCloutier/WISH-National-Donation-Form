                <div class="rich-text"><h3>What is a card security code?</h3>
<p>The Card Security Code (CSC) is a 3- or 4-digit number printed on 
your credit card. It provides added security when you use your card on 
the Internet or over the phone. The number appears only on the card 
itself, not on receipts or statements.</p>
<p>We ask for the CSC when you enter your payment information. This 
helps ensure that anyone making a donation to the Make-A-Wish Foundation
 has the card in his or her possession and is not using a stolen credit 
card number.</p>
<div class="left">
<h3>For Visa, Mastercard and Discover cards</h3>
<p>Turn the card over and look at the signature box. You will find 
either the entire 16-digit credit card number or just the last 4 digits,
 followed by the 3-digit CSC.</p>

<div class="right">
<h3>For American Express cards</h3>
<p>The CSC is always located above the account number on the face of the
 card, sometimes on the left side and sometimes on the right. Note: Some
 American Express cards have a 4-digit number below the account number. 
This is not the CSC.</p>
